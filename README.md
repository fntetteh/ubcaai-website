<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The UBC Africa Awareness Initiative (AAI) is a student-run organization, started in 2002, committed to improving discourse surrounding and including Africa at UBC. The club currently has a basic website which is seldomly used by the members and even the executive team.There is less traffic on their current website compared to other student run clubs on UBC campus. Below is a screenshot and link to AAI's current website.

My proposal is to redesign the website dynamically with more interactive features. Students would be able to easily use and navigate the proposed website because it is intuitive and interactive.
